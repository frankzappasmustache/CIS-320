	<h5>All three of these images are from another server, and to display them I simply included the image's URL in the <q style="color:purple;font-weight:bold;">src</q> attribute. If I were to use an image hosted on the same server but in a different folder, I would simply include the full path to the file (e.g. /path/to/image.png).</h5>
	<h5>If someone using a screenreader were to view this page, they would hear the text included in the alt attribute for each image, which tells them the comic author and comic name. It is important that alt text is included for people who may be blind or not able to read the page for other reasons. The alt text provides a description of the image tha can be read to them for context.</h5>
